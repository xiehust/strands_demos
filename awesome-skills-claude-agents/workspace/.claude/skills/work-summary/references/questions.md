## Tips for Information Gathering

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with report type and format, then dive into specifics
2. **Use examples**: "For instance, 'Led migration project that reduced costs by 20%'"
3. **Encourage quantification**: Always ask "Can you put a number to that?"
4. **Clarify ambiguity**: If something is unclear, ask for specific examples
5. **Confirm understanding**: Summarize what you've heard and ask for confirmation
6. **Suggest structure**: If user provides unstructured information, organize it and confirm
